## About
RMMV ships with almost no scripting documentation. `rpg_core.js` is documented, but none of the other files are.

As a result, beginning scripters must sift through the code and experiment until they understand how all the pieces fit together.

So, I am attempting to add documentation to all of the vanilla `.js` files, so that it will be easier for people to get started.

If you would like to document previous versions of RMMV, users with projects in development may benefit.

If you are a plugin creator, you can help by adding documentation to your plugin files, or by providing an external reference of your own.
